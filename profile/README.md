# Iago Mod

## Short Introduction
Iago's Another Go ORM, following the single value of SIMPLICITY. That is what matters to us, we should keep everything simple in an Go ORM, just like any other go-native useful tool.

## Contribution Guidelines
Iago is a very young tool, as well as its authors, and we have no specific guidlines, we would be more than happy if we could get help in managing open source project contribution processes and guidelines.
